The "Too many open files" error is a system limitation issue. The other messages are dependency warnings that generally won't affect functionality.

Let's fix the main issue:

1. First, check your current file descriptor limits:

Since this is happening on a server, the "Too many open files" error indicates your server has reached its maximum file descriptor limit. This is a common issue in high-traffic applications or when many files/sockets remain open.

For immediate server fixes:

1. **Increase system limits**:
   - Edit `/etc/security/limits.conf` to increase nofile limits
   - Add lines like:
     ```
     *       soft    nofile  65535
     *       hard    nofile  65535
     ```
   - Also check `/etc/sysctl.conf` and add `fs.file-max = 100000`
   - Apply with `sysctl -p`

2. **Identify processes keeping files open**:
   - Run `lsof | wc -l` to count open files
   - Use `lsof -p <pid>` on your app's process to see its open files

3. **Application-level improvements**:
   - Ensure your application properly closes file handles/connections
   - Consider connection pooling for database connections
   - Implement timeouts for long-running connections

The dependency warnings are minor issues related to peer dependencies and shouldn't affect functionality.

Would you like me to provide a specific configuration for your server type or help troubleshoot which processes might be causing this issue?
