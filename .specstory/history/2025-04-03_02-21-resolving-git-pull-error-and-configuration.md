I see you're encountering a Git error when trying to pull from the `testing` branch. Let me explain what's happening and how to resolve it.

This is a common Git situation that occurs when:
1. You have local commits on your current branch
2. There are also new commits on the remote branch you're trying to pull from
3. Git needs to know how you want to handle merging these different versions of history

Git is asking you to specify one of three strategies for handling this situation:

1. **Merge** (`git config pull.rebase false`):
   - Creates a merge commit that combines your local changes with remote changes
   - Preserves the complete history but can make it more complex

2. **Rebase** (`git config pull.rebase true`):
   - Replays your local commits on top of the remote changes
   - Creates a cleaner, linear history but rewrites commit history

3. **Fast-forward only** (`git config pull.ff only`):
   - Only allows pulls that can be fast-forwarded
   - Fails if there are divergent changes

Let me help you set this up. I'll run a command to configure Git to use rebase, which is generally preferred for cleaner history:


---

```bash
git config pull.rebase true
```

```
zahiruliman@Zahiruls-MacBook-Air studio-app-temp % 

```

Now that we've configured Git to use rebase, let's try pulling again:


---

_****_

```bash
git pull --tags origin testing
```

```
zahiruliman@Zahiruls-MacBook-Air studio-app-temp % git pull --tags origin testing
From github.com:infyramy/studio-app-temp
 * branch            testing    -> FETCH_HEAD
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/testing.
zahiruliman@Zahiruls-MacBook-Air studio-app-temp %
```

Great! The pull was successful. Here's what happened:
1. We configured Git to use rebase strategy
2. Git successfully pulled the changes from the remote `testing` branch
3. Your local changes were rebased on top of the remote changes
4. The tags were also updated

Your repository is now up to date with the remote `testing` branch, and the divergent branches have been reconciled using the rebase strategy. You can continue working on your branch as normal.

Is there anything specific about the changes you'd like me to explain?
